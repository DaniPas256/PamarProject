        Ternopil is an Ukrainian city with a population of approximately 200 thousand inhabitants. <br>
        The city is a major cultural (museums, theatres), educational (high schools) and industrial <br>
        hub in the region. The history of Ternopil reaches as far back as the year 1540, when the <br>
        city was established on the territory of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland.',

         Our collaboration with the city of Ternopil has started with the implementation of our pilot programme for the duration of 6 months. <br>
         Before we signed the contract, we have had a couple of online meetings defining the specifics of our cooperation. The implementation has went smoothly and without any disruptions.<br><br>
         We are positively surprised by the openness of city of Ternopil to the new technologies and innovations such as the Open Data portal.

        As a part of the implementation process of the Open Data portal in Ternopil, <br>
        we have provided necessary instructions for the administration workers <br>
        and editors, as well as essential documents such as manuals  <br> and technical documentation.
        <br> <br>
        We have also provided additional features to the portal (compatible with  <br>
        the Ukrainian law), so that it would fulfill all the requirements and  <br>
        standards relating to the open government data.<br>
        Several language versions make it easier for tourists and  <br>
